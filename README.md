# Covid-Browser-Extension
Simple extension made for personal use to stay updated on covid-19 data.
In order to avoid chrome/firefox content security policy and for the plot to work, plotly.min.js should be added as a <script> in popup.html.
This file can be found in the plotly.js github: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/
